# Alabaster theme for [zed](https://zed.dev)

Port of the [Alabaster Sublime Scheme](https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster) by Nikita Prokopov for zed editor.

Currently, this is basically a theme generated with [theme-importer](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/crates/theme_importer) from the [tonsky/vscode-theme-alabaster](https://github.com/tonsky/vscode-theme-alabaster). It's a start, but it needs imporvements, so feel free to contribute.

## Installation

Downlad the `alabaster-color-theme.json` and place it in your `~/.config/zed/themes` directory. Restart zed editor and select the theme in theme selector.
